# The Grand Return
In 2022 I used this github, not as often as I should have but I did use it. Then I decided that I don't need a public repository and it's just slowing down my progress and my projects, and that I could run everything locally and it would all be fine. That worked until I ended getting distracted from projects, and then distracted from the distractions and before I knew it this place was gathering dust and wasn't exactly the shining beacon of competency I wanted it to be. Now here I am attempting to wipe the dust off and get those grimy spots clean again, my actual skills if anything have improved but I just need to return to all these old half-broken toys and fix some of them, improve some of the others and maybe start building some new ones.
